# DTOL-yaml-validator

A "for-fun" rust project to validate the yamls used in the DTOL ticket system.

Currently, this only works on Darwin yaml files. This is as they are "full" yamls produced by the assembly team.

Other groups use a truncated version which required a seperate schema per variation.
