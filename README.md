# TOL-Yaml-Validator

A "for-fun" rust project to validate the yamls used in the TOL ticket system.

Currently, this only works on darwin yaml files. This is as they are "full" yamls produced by the assembly team.

Other groups use truncated minimal / essential versions which require a seperate schema per variation.
